	This template is based on work done by Mike Catanzaro and Gabe Angelini-Knoll, both formerly of the WSU math department, with updates in 2019 by Aaron Willcock (ez9213@wayne.edu) for the updated WSU dissertation and thesis formatting guidelines. The unedited, accepted latex upon which this thesis template was most recently adapted can be found at (https://github.com/aarontwillcock/wsu-ms-cs-tufc).
	It is currently maintained by Clayton Hayes (clayton.hayes@wayne.edu) of the WSU Libraries, who created the original template and has made some slight adjustments to facilitate code readability.
