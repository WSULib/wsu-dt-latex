# wsu-dt-latex

This template builds on dissertations prepared in LaTeX by Michael Catanzaro and Gabriel Angelini-Knoll, both formerly of the Wayne State University mathematics department. They have been added to and synthesized for broader use, and to address some specific issues related to the inclusion of a list of tables and/or figures, and related to overly-long titles.

This template was last update updated on 2019-03-10 by Aaron Willcock (ez9213@wayne.edu) for the updated WSU dissertation and thesis formatting guidelines. The template can be compiled with:

```sh
pdflatex main.tex
```
or...
```sh
lualatex main.tex
```

The unedited, accepted latex upon which this thesis template was most recently adapted can be found at (https://github.com/aarontwillcock/wsu-ms-cs-tufc).

It is not an official template, but does follow the guidelines laid out by Wayne State University's Graduate School Manual: https://gradschool.wayne.edu/phd/disseration_and_thesis_format_guidelines.pdf
