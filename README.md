# wsu-dt-latex

This template builds on dissertations prepared in LaTeX by Michael Catanzaro and Gabriel Angelini-Knoll, both formerly of the Wayne State University mathematics department. They have been added to and synthesized for broader use, and to address some specific issues related to the inclusion of a list of tables and/or figures, and related to overly-long titles.

It is not an official template, but does follow the guidelines laid out by Wayne State University's Graduate School Manual: https://gradschool.wayne.edu/phd/disseration_and_thesis_format_guidelines.pdf
