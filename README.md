# Wayne State University Dissertation and Thesis LaTeX Template

This template builds on dissertations prepared in LaTeX by [Michael Catanzaro](https://faculty.sites.iastate.edu/mjcatanz/) and [Gabriel Angelini-Knoll](https://users.math.msu.edu/users/angelini/), both formerly of the Wayne State University [Department of Mathematics](http://www.clas.wayne.edu/math/). This template has some additions and synthesizations by [Clayton Hayes](https://library.wayne.edu/info/staff-directory/as6348) (clayton.hayes@wayne.edu) for addressing issues related to the inclusion of a list of tables and/or figures and overly-long titles. This template was last update updated on 2019-03-10 by [Aaron Willcock](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaronwillcock/) (ez9213@wayne.edu) for the updated WSU dissertation and thesis formatting guidelines.

## Compiling

```sh
pdflatex main.tex
```
lualatex,
```sh

```
